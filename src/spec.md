# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Redesign the Dashboard UI into a premium gold + dark jade + emerald/turquoise theme with subtle animated “gold energy” ambience, futuristic glass “Energy Capsules,” an upgraded animated score ring, and a new “Future Projection” section—without changing any existing Dashboard functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Update Dashboard styling to a consistent premium palette (gold highlights, dark jade for health values, emerald/turquoise for water/nutrition, ruby-red only for warnings) across backgrounds, panels, borders, icons, and interactive states.
- Add a subtle, performance-safe animated gold caustics/light-ray overlay behind Dashboard content (non-interactive overlay layer).
- Redesign routine sections into semi-transparent glass “Energy Capsules” with soft glow and a completion-based fill that animates upward as completion increases (using existing completion computations).
- Upgrade the central score area to a “portal” feel: gentle pulse, gold shimmer contours, and a thin rotating spark ring effect around the score ring.
- Add a dedicated “Future Projection” section with exactly three panels (Biological Youth, Body Form, Energy & Focus), each showing a value, trend indicator, and a small silhouette outline.
- Add minimal micro-animations on Dashboard interactions: smoother slider feel, supplement completion wipe/highlight, and a brief energy pulse when saving training—without new popups or workflow changes.

**User-visible outcome:** The Dashboard appears as a premium gold/jade/emerald interface with subtle animated energy ambience, glass capsule routine tiles that visibly fill with progress, a pulsing/shimmering score ring with rotating spark effect, a new Future Projection block with three trend panels, and smoother, more polished interaction animations—while all existing tracking and calculations behave the same.
