  "summary": "Most requested UI/UX changes appear implemented: a new gold/jade/emerald palette (theme variables + Tailwind colors), EnergyCapsule component for routine sections, ScoreRing portal effects (spark ring + pulse classes), Future Projection section with 3 panels and silhouette image, and micro-animations for supplements (wipe trigger) and training save (pulse trigger). Some requirements are not fully evidenced in the diff summary, notably the specific animated caustics/light-ray overlay implementation and inclusion/usage of the required overlay texture images, plus a localization issue in the Future Projection header.",

      "requirement": "Subtle animated 'gold energy source' background overlay on Dashboard with slow drift and pointer-events disabled.",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not show the actual implementation of the fixed full-screen animated overlay layer (including pointer-events: none) nor any explicit Dashboard-only scoping. index.css is truncated right as Energy Capsule styles begin, so the caustics/light-ray overlay cannot be verified from provided evidence.",

      "requirement": "Future Projection section label should respect existing German/English toggle where applicable.",
