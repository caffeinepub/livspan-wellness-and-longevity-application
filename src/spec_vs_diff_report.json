  "summary": "Diff implements post-auth redirect-to-dashboard logic, removes the specific LivSpan logo image usage from the LoginScreen (and likely Header per summary), and adds more defensive error logging + a custom router error fallback. However, the underlying root cause of the initial-load router error (“Something went wrong”) is not clearly identified/fixed from the provided diff summary, and there are additional unrequested UI additions/changes (new images and navigation UI).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Identify and fix the client-side runtime error that causes the app to render the router error fallback screen (\"Something went wrong\") on initial load, so authenticated users can reliably see the app without crashing.",
      "reason": "The diff shows hardened loading states and additional console logging plus a RouterErrorFallback component, but it does not clearly demonstrate the specific runtime error being fixed (i.e., removing the cause of the router-level error fallback on initial load). Without explicit evidence of the crash cause being addressed, the requirement is not verifiably implemented.",

    {
      "description": "Added a new feature-preview grid on the login screen with three additional images/icons (Autophagy/Longevity/LIV Token).",
      "reason": "REQ-2 only asked to remove the LivSpan logo image (\"/assets/MagicEraser_251230_145221.png\") and avoid broken image placeholders; it did not request adding new images to the login UI.",

    },
    {
      "description": "Header/navigation appears to be significantly revamped (sheet-based side menu, extensive styling/branding text).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest did not request a navigation redesign; it only required removing the logo image from the authenticated header area.",
