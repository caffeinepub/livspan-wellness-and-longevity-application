  "summary": "Diff introduces reusable non-slider input primitives (StepperInput, ChipsInput) and applies them to NutritionCard and StressCard; it also uses ChronographDial as a primary control in FastingTimer (fastingHours) and SleepCard (sleepQuality). Global CSS utilities were expanded to support the luxury/glass look and subtle transitions. Based on the provided diff summary, most requested slider replacements appear implemented for the shown routine cards, but the BodyCompositionCard changes are truncated so full verification is limited.",
